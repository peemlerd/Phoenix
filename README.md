# About this project
Which format of the Fall 2020 semester do Swarthmore students prefer? Which factors inform the preference? What are the pros-cons-repercussions of each reopening plan? These are the three questions I sought to explore through this project to shed light on the the 'Fall 2020 reopening plan' conversation. Many articles on Fall 2020 reopening plan rely heavily either on survey results or stories, but not both. In reality, numbers and stories complement each other: stories make numbers stick to people, whereas numbers make stories more robust. Hence, my goal is to combine clear-cut data analysis with powerful stories to convey the complexity of the Fall 2020 reopening plans, which culminates in this longform piece titled [Survey: Awaiting Fall 2020 plan, students face housing uncertainty, safety concerns](https://swarthmorephoenix.com/2020/06/30/students-weigh-in-on-fall-2020/). 

# Goals
1. *Convey the complexity of reopening plans across demographics*. Whether the fall semester is entirely online, hybrid, or fully on-campus has different repercussions for students on different demograpic groups. For instance, an international student may be less likely to take a semester off due to visa concerns. 
2. *Systematically survey which factors weigh onto students' preference*. Students receiving a lot of financial aid might prefer a hybrid option because they rely on on-campus housing, whereas more financially-independent students might care more about timely graduation and networking opportunities.
3. *Promote an informed, data-driven Fall 2020 discussion* by weaving poignant stories, insightful infographics, and data altogether.

# Work process
1. **Define the goals and the scope of this article (see above).** Because we were interested in whether students from different demographic groups have different preference on the reopening plan AND whether they weigh each factor differently, we made it a point to include demographic questions in the survey.

2. **Create a survey**. Surveys should be brief yet meaningful. Bayliss and I edited the survey multiple times to ensure every question is clear. Questions on how confident students were/are in securing stable, sufficient housing during Spring/Fall 2020 were added as many students expressed anxiety on their housing situation. A few questions on demographics, housing situation, and preference on Fall 2020 were mandatory, and the rest optional, so respondents can complete the survey within one minute. The rest of the questions focused on factors weighing onto students' preference, their experience with COVID-19 and thoughts on the reopening plan, and whether they were interested in being interviewed further.
