# About this project
Which format of the Fall 2020 semester do Swarthmore students prefer? Which factors inform the preference? What are the pros-cons-repercussions of each reopening plan? These are the three questions I sought to explore through this project to shed light on the the 'Fall 2020 reopening plan' conversation. Many articles on Fall 2020 reopening plan rely heavily either on survey results or stories, but not both. In reality, numbers and stories complement each other: stories make numbers stick to people, whereas numbers make stories more robust. Hence, my goal is to combine clear-cut data analysis with powerful stories to convey the complexity of the Fall 2020 reopening plans, which culminates in this longform piece titled [Survey: Awaiting Fall 2020 plan, students face housing uncertainty, safety concerns](https://swarthmorephoenix.com/2020/06/30/students-weigh-in-on-fall-2020/).
